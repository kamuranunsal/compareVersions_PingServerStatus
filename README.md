# SWE Interview Homework Questions

## Project Requirements

## Util - 'compare versions'

Implement a utility (in Go, Python, or Java). Feel free to use a framework, if desired.
Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1
If version1 < version2 return -1
otherwise return 0
You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the 'dot' character. The 'dot' character does not represent a
decimal point and is used to separate number sequences. For instance '2.5' is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth
second-level revision of the second first-level revision.
Here is an example of version numbers ordering: 0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 1.2.9.9.9.9 < 1.3 < 1.3.4 < 1.10

##Application - 'tracking web server'

Implement a small small webserver (in Go, Python, or Java). Feel free to use a framework, if desired.
/ping - returns response code 200 and string OK when file /tmp/ok is present,
